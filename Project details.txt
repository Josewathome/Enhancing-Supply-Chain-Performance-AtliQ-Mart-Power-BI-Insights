Project Details: Supply Chain Analytics for AtliQ Mart

Project Overview:

As the newly appointed Data Analyst at AtliQ Mart's supply chain team, my role is to address the problem of declining customer satisfaction due to service issues, which has led to a loss of key customers not renewing their annual contracts. The objective is to develop a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the 'On-time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels for all customers on a daily basis. This dashboard will empower the management to respond promptly to service issues and ensure a higher level of customer satisfaction. The project involves creating metrics, building a dashboard, and extracting meaningful insights from the available data.

Project Steps:

1. Data Understanding and Preparation:

Review the provided CSV files (dim_customers, dim_products, dim_date, dim_targets_orders, fact_order_lines, fact_orders_aggregate) and understand the structure and content of each file.
Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and ensure data integrity for further analysis.

2. Metrics Creation:

Utilize the business knowledge and the provided metrics list to create the required metrics:
Total Order Lines
Line Fill Rate (LIFR %)
Volume Fill Rate (VOFR %)
Total Orders
On Time Delivery % (OT %)
In Full Delivery % (IF %)
On Time In Full % (OTIF %)
On Time Target (Average of On-Time Target)
In Full Target (Average of In-Full Target)
On Time In Full Target (Average of OTIF Target)

3. Dashboard Development:

Use Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power BI to design and build the interactive dashboard.
Organize the dashboard with clear visualizations that present the metrics in a user-friendly manner.
Include filters and slicers to allow users to interact with the data and focus on specific aspects.

4. Dashboard Components:

Visualize trends and performance metrics over time, allowing users to track improvements and identify patterns.
Create dynamic visualizations for key metrics such as Line Fill Rate, Volume Fill Rate, On Time Delivery %, In Full Delivery %, and On Time In Full %.
Display customer-specific metrics alongside overall metrics for comparative analysis.
Represent performance against set targets for On Time, In Full, and On Time In Full using bar charts or KPI cards.

5. Insights Generation:

Apart from the listed metrics, extract additional insights from the data that can aid decision-making:
Identify trends in customer behavior and preferences.
Analyze if specific products or categories are more prone to service issues.
Uncover correlations between delivery performance and geographical locations.
Detect seasonal variations in service levels and customer orders.
Highlight any correlation between order placement dates and service issues.

6. User Documentation:

Create documentation to guide users on how to navigate and utilize the dashboard effectively.
Include explanations for each metric, visualization, and filter to ensure users understand the insights presented.

7. Stakeholder Presentation:

Present the completed dashboard and insights to the management team.
Demonstrate how the dashboard can be used to monitor service levels, identify issues, and make informed decisions.

Project Completion:

Upon completion of the project, the management at AtliQ Mart will have access to a powerful supply chain analytics dashboard. This tool will provide real-time insights into the 'On-time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels, enabling swift identification and resolution of service issues. Additionally, the dashboard will facilitate data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction and support the company's expansion plans to other cities.
